  'The Probability Mass Function (PMF) describes the likelihood that a discrete random variable X will take on a specific value x. It answers the question: "What is the probability that X equals x?" This contrasts with the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), which gives the probability that X is within a range of values (instead of one specific value). The term "mass" reflects the notion that probability is concentrated at discrete points, with each point carrying a certain amount of probability weight.',

  'The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) gives the probability that a continuous random variable X is less than or equal to a specific value x. It is defined as the integral of the probability density function (PDF) from negative infinity up to x. While the integral symbolically begins at minus infinity, in many real-world cases (like height or age), the PDF is zero below a minimum value, so the accumulation effectively starts at that point. The CDF increases from 0 to 1 as x moves from the far left to the far right of the distribution. For example, suppose the PDF is f(t) = 2t on the interval from 0 to 1. To find the probability that X is less than or equal to 0.6, compute F(0.6) = integral from 0 to 0.6 of 2t dt = 0.36. This means there is a 36% chance that X falls at or below 0.6.',
